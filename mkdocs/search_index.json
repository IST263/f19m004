The policy in effect at\nthe School of Information Studies defines our expectations for academic honesty and\nholds students accountable for the integrity of all work they submit. Students should\nunderstand that it is their responsibility to learn about course-specific expectations, as\nwell as about university-wide academic integrity expectations. The pilot policy governs\nappropriate citation and use of sources, the integrity of work submitted in exams and\nassignments, and the veracity of signatures on attendance sheets and other verification\nof participation in class activities. The pilot policy also prohibits students from submitting\nthe same work in more than one class without receiving written authorization in advance\nfrom both instructors. Under the pilot policy, students found in violation are subject to\ngrade sanctions determined by the course instructor and non-grade sanctions\ndetermined by the School or College where the course is offered. SU students are\nrequired to read an online summary of the university\u2019s academic integrity expectations\nand provide an electronic signature agreeing to abide by them twice a year during preterm\ncheck-in on MySlice. For more information, see \nhttp://academicintegrity.syr.edu\n.\n\n\nDisability-Related Accommodations\n\n\nSyracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to a climate of\nmutual respect and full participation. If you believe that you need accommodations for a\ndisability, please contact the Office of Disability Services (ODS),\ndisabilityservices.syr.edu, located at 804 University Avenue, room 309, or call\n315.443.4498 for an appointment to discuss your needs and the process for requesting\naccommodations. ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related\naccommodations and will issue \u201cAccommodation Authorization Letters\u201d to students as\nappropriate. Since accommodations may require early planning and generally are not\nprovided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon as possible. Our goal at the iSchool\nis to create learning environments that are useable, equitable, inclusive and welcoming.\nIf there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to\nyour inclusion or accurate assessment or achievement, please meet with me to discuss\nadditional strategies beyond official accommodations that may be helpful to your\nsuccess.\n\n\nReligious Observances Policy:\n\n\nSU\u2019s religious observances policy, found at supolicies.syr.edu/emp_ben/\nreligious_observance.htm , recognizes the diversity of faiths represented in the campus School of Information Studies (iSchool) Syracuse University\ncommunity and protects the rights of students, faculty, and staff to observe religious holy\ndays according to their tradition. Under the policy, students should have an opportunity\nto make up any examination, study, or work requirements that may be missed due to a\nreligious observance provided they notify their instructors no later than the end of the\nsecond week of classes through an online notification form in MySlice listed under\nStudent Services/Enrollment/My Religious Observances/Add a Notification.",

It will seem foreign when you start but be a little patient & persistant.\n\n\n1. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\n\n\nIf you have used programs like MS-Word, you have used an IDE. IDEs are specialized programs that provide features and tools that make your development process efficient. Just like you would use MS-Word to write and format papers, resumes, or letters we will use something similar in this class to write HTML, CSS and some Javascript.  \n\n\nVS Code\n\n\nYou can download the \nfree\n version from \nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/download\n. Choose the correct installer based on your computer OS.\n\n\nOnce the download is complete, launch the installer and follow the steps.\n\n\n2. Git & GitHub\n\n\nThese are 2 different tools - don't let the names confuse you. Below is a brief explanation of what they are \n\n\ngit\n\n\ngit is a program that you install on \nyour computer\n which can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. It is a distributed version control system primarily used in software development. You might have used the 'Track Changes' feature in MS-Word - git does all that and a lot lot more.\n\n\nGitHub\n\n\nGitHub is a web-based git server. It complements git in ways that makes it possible for a team of developers to contribute to a single project. It also provides a way to store your code remotely. \n\n\nFollow these steps to configure your computer\n\n\nSetting up Git & GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignup for a Free GitHub Account. \nIf you already have a GitHub Account skip to step 2\n\n\n\n\nGo to \ngithub.com\n\n\nClick Signup \n\n\nChoose a username like \nnetid-su\n. Ex: My username would be \nakadajis-su\n\n\nYou can use your SU email \n\n\nClick 'Create an Account'\n\n\nIn the next page choose 'Unlimited Public repositories for free' plan.\n\n\nClick 'Continue'\n\n\nChoose the appropriate boxes in the next step\n\n\nClick 'Submit'  \n\n\nYou should have received an email from GitHub. Open the email and click 'Verify your email address' to complete the process. You now have a GitHub account. \n\n\nYou will need your GitHub username and password in Step 2  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling GitHub Desktop Client\n\n\n\n\nGo to \ndesktop.github.com\n\n\nDownload the program installer appropriate for your version of the OS. \n\n\nOnce the download is complete, launch it and follow the steps to install it\n\n\nAfter it is installed, launch it and click on 'Sign into GitHub' and enter you GitHub username and password that you created in Step 1\n\n\nIn the 'Configure Git' screen enter your Name and Email and click 'Continue'\n\n\nClick 'Finish' to complete GitHub & Git installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Setup Class Folder aka Repo \non GitHub\n\n\nThis final step will walk you through downloading the class folder aka \nrepo\n from GitHub.     \n\n\n These first 5 steps will create your course folder/repo on GitHub \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the link \nhttps://classroom.github.com/a/NEH56j6G\n to get started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be asked to signin with your GitHub username and password if you are not signed in. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see a page like the one shown below.

Media can be images, links to videos, audio files and content. You can paste the links in a MS-Word document or a regular text file. Some of the content that you find on the internet can be copyrighted so make sure you also save the source information.  \n\n\nSubmit a \nSitemap\n for your project.

You will most likely be adding and/or removing HTML markup that you submitted previously. That is totally fine. Before you start including CSS it is recommended that you have\n\n\n\n\nAn idea of the color scheme you intend on using in the site.\n\n\n\n\nv3 using Bootstrap\n\n\nIn this phase you are required to enchance your website by using a CSS framework like Bootstrap. By the end of the this phase your site should be\n\n\n\n\nResponsive. You can check for validity at \nW3C Mobile Checker\n\n\nAll pages should have valid HTML markup\n\n\nRun through WAVE tool and should have 0 errors\n\n\nYou should research and use advanced Bootstrap componenents or JS plugins\n\n\n\n\nDemo/Review with Instructor\n\n\nThis is your chance to meet with the instructor one-on-one to discuss and review your website.
