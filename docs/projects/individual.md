More information on each of the above criteria is below.


### Meeting Milestones ###

This project is intended to be completed in weekly sprints/chunks. You are expected to commit weekly work or updates into GitHub. There should be at a minimum of 1 weekly commit starting at Week 3 before the final project is complete. Below is the list of project milestones.


 Due By | Milestone | Deliverable(s) 
------------ | -------------  |
Week 2 - 3 | Come up with a website topic | Submit half page project proposal
Week 3 - 5 | Research and collect website content and graphic media (images, video, etc.) | You can collect the content in a MS. Word doc or text file. If you are using copyrighted images and/or video make sure you cite them accordingly.
Week 4 - 6 | Create, Submit and Revise Wireframes | Wireframes 
Week 6 - 12 | Implement/Code/Revise the website | Website

Not meeting milestones will seriously jeopradize your chances to complete the project in the desired timeline. It will also cost you points. 

### Wireframes ###

These are the project blue prints. You will use these as guides to implement the web pages. There are vast number of tools you can use to create wireframes. We will talk more about wireframes during class starting around Week 4.

### Resource & Code Organization ###

Here we look at your coding practices. Good code and resource organization makes for an efficient website, and also increases efficiency during debug, and updates. The metrics used to evaluate this criteria are

- Run through W3C Validator aka WAG compliancy
- Aptly named web pages, images 
- Well organized folder structure 
- Well organized CSS 
- Well organized HTML

### Final Website ###
We will be looking at the following in your final website.

- Layout
- Color Schemes
- Use of external frameworks and/or libraries
- Responsiveness 


### Demo/Review with Instructor ###

This is your chance to meet with the instructor one-on-one to discuss and review your website. You are encouraged to use this opportunity to highlight any specific part of the process and/or the website. 

This is a good chance to discuss the process, and highlight any specific modules.
